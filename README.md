### Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Yinkusadel/js-coding-challenges.git

```

- Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

To run ESLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
yarn eslint:check
```

Or to automatically fix issues found for ESLint (where possible):

```bash
yarn eslint
```

You can also check against Prettier:

```bash
yarn format:check
```

and to have it fix (to the best of its ability) any format issues, run:

```bash
yarn format
```
